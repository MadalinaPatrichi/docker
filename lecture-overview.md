# Lecture overview

In the previous VM lecture, we talked about deploying out application using the most basic facilities available as IaaS. Namely, we moved our app onto a Virtual Machine \(instance\) running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and set up the required virtualized networks to make it available to the outside world.

During this lecture, we'll try to make the deployment process more efficient, consistent and flexible with the use of containers.  We will use the terms of containerization and dockerizing interchangeably, however, we will basically refer to the same concept. The term dockerizing is more specific in the sense that we will use an application called Docker to help us. 

Before we dig actually deploy out application within a container, we will have a short look again over what is a container, how is it different from a VM, then we will go over the architecture of Docker and explain some of the terms specific to this platform.

During the second part of the lecture, we will focus on preparing the Docker environment, building and publishing an image and finally we will interact with our container.

Finally, we will try to take our containerized application even further and have a look at various ways of persisting the data generated by our app.
